1034 days (April 24 2019-February 21 2022) 
1034 x 5 = 5170 salah to make up 
I'm gonna do x2 qadha a day (F-D-A-M-I, repeat x1) 
5170 / 10 salah a day = 517 days to finish Starting from 30th September 2025, I would finish at 1st of March 2027. 

I only did four days, or 8 sets of qadha in the time passed.

So from 14 January 2026, I have 513 days to finish -> 11 June 2027.
