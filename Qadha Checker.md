I should try and make up some when I have time. Remember, 2 cycles only takes an hour.

1034 days (April 24 2019-February 21 2022) 
1034 x 5 = 5170 salah to make up 
I'm gonna do x2 qadha a day (F-D-A-M-I, repeat x1) 
5170 / 10 salah a day = 517 days to finish Starting from 30th September 2025, I would finish at 1st of March 2027. 
In my second phase, planning 14 Jan 2026-11 Jun 2027, I did 11 sets of qadha.

5170 - 11 = 5159.
5159 / 5 (one round a day) = 1032 days.
Starting from 25th March 2026, I should finish by 20 Jan 2029.
