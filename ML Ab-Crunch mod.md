*First I boil cup of water in microwave, not super hot but not warm. I dip spidey in for 15 sec, take it out. Take apart the arms and neck (you don't want swivel parts to stay in heat or it'll become loose)
Next I put it back in for maybe a minute. Then take out and wait 30 seconds to cool down, then run it over cold water (never crack open while too hot or plastic will warp, like the holes on my Spidey)
Then drill small holes on each side (bit higher so it's not as noticeable, unless you're covering with sculpt)*

I will fill in the holes after with epoxy putty, then sand the area down and repaint.
*I had to drill lot further than usual, that's why I couldn't crack it open in the first place. Then I used dull ice pick and cracked it open slowly on each side. (if it don't open easily, dip it back into hot water, wait a bit then run cold water again)*

*Next use a dremel and dremel the top so it'll create more ROM (range of motion) but on the part next to the red circle DON'T over-dremel wide or the torso peg will just fall off. (made this mistake few times) (I usually keep side wall of inner circle untouched just to be safe)*

*Yeah it's up to u. U can always shave parts of the 2 parts and super glue it back and should look like oem. Look at all those edges. You can sand em or super glue to make it round.*
