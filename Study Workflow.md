File Structure:
- File Templates for MOCs, Concepts.
- MOCs Folder, or Maps of Content, which are based on the module of interest i.e., MOC_CS2IS.
- Concepts Folder which isn't limited by the module of interest. Concepts link to their Sources.
- Sources Folder, which includes slides from the module units, scans of hand-written annotations, alongside any necessary content like code snippets.
- Notes involve tags, which go at the top of the note:
	- Completion status tags i.e., seed, growth, evergreen.
	- Subject tags i.e., ux-design, backend, logic (these could appear in one or multiple MOCs).
	- Content type tags i.e., definition, formula, code-snippet, concept.
Tags are broad and categorical, links are specific and relational.

Study Workflow:
- Read over the contents of the lecture slides for exposure to its topics.
- While watching video-lecture OR in-person lecture, hand-write annotations for the lecture slides while taking in the lecturer's dialogue.
- After lecture, I need to apply the Feynman Technique. 
Create a note titled after the concept of interest.
Explain the topic in a paragraph as if you're explaining it to a 10 year old.
Link concepts and sources.
The bottom of the note should be a footer including its context (what modules it relates to), prerequisites (what do I need to know for this concept?) and next steps (what does this concept lead into?).
**The Rule of Thumb:** If you can give the topic its own title and explain it in one paragraph (Feynman style), it’s a concept.
**The "So What?" Shift:** When the lecturer stops defining a term and starts showing how to _apply_ it (e.g., shifting from "What is an Interface" to "How to implement an Interface").
**The "Prerequisite" Check:** If Topic B requires you to understand Topic A first, they are almost certainly separate concepts.

> Open Book Exam Preparation: The Zettelkasten Export Method
> 
> OVERVIEW This workflow converts an atomized Zettelkasten (individual concept notes) into a single, searchable PDF optimized for high-pressure open-book exams.
> 
> 1. THE "STITCH" ARCHITECTURE The Map of Content (MOC) acts as the spine of your exam document.
> 
>     Transclusion: In your MOC, use the "!" prefix for links (e.g., ![[Concept Name]]). This embeds the actual content of the note into the MOC rather than just a link.
> 
>     Hierarchy: Organize the MOC by Subject Tags (e.g., #logic, #backend) to ensure related concepts appear together in the final PDF.
> 
> 2. FORMATTING FOR SPEED (The 5-Second Rule) In an exam, you must find information in under 5 seconds.
> 
>     H1 Headers: Use H1 for Concept Titles. Most PDF readers use these to auto-generate a clickable Table of Contents.
> 
>     Feynman Summary: Keep your "10-year-old explanation" at the top of every note to provide an instant mental "reset."
> 
>     Keyword Bolding: Bold critical technical terms (ACID, Heuristics, Syntax) so they pop while scrolling.
> 
>     Visuals: Embed diagrams or handwritten scans directly into the Concept notes so they export with the text.
> 
> 3. EXPORT SETTINGS
> 
>     PDF Index: Ensure the first page of your PDF is the MOC list.
> 
>     Searchability: If using scans of handwriting, ensure they are passed through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) so they are searchable via CTRL+F.
> 
> 4. THE EXAM-DAY "WAR CHEST" Have a single folder on your desktop containing:
> 
>     The Master PDF: Your compiled Concept notes.
> 
>     The Sources Folder: Original lecture slides/PDFs for niche, "deep-dive" questions.
> 
>     Search Index: A "cheat sheet" on page 1 of your PDF listing page numbers for common formulas or complex definitions.
> 
> 5. WHY THIS WORKS Unlike a standard set of slides, this PDF is written in YOUR voice (via the Feynman Technique), making the information easier to retrieve under stress. It bridges the gap between atomic learning and linear examination.
