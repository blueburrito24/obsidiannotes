- I already have Vallejo white so that's sorted. I would just need to ==get rid of the scarf and resculpt the head a bit to have a masked look with no mouth detail, alongside shaving off the mask and eyes.==
- From there I just have to ==dye the figure black, then shade with bold pyrrole red, paint the fingers, spider symbol and lenses on with white and then repaint the hair.==
- Also need to ==add toe articulation and do the [[ML Ab-Crunch mod]].==

- ==Do the [[ML Ab-Crunch mod]] on this figure.==
- ==I want to increase the forward-shoulder range,== so I'm going to attempt to adapt the butterfly mod.
- If the inner structure of the shoulders is similar to the Vulcan body I will ==carve out the front gap of the shoulders for more forward-range, alongside the actual inner-tract of the shoulder joints.==
- I'm also gonna ==repaint these Marvel Select heads + the Marvel Select's "backpack" accessory with all its tendrils + dremel out the joints on the Select hands and mod it with some odd joints from AliExpress.== 
- I'm also gonna ==paint out the legs of the spider-symbol and round out the body, then add new legs based on the 12in design.==
- Also ==add boot swivel using screws!==
- ==*Heat up the fig with a hairdryer, pop the pins, 1-2 layer of super glue on both sides of joint (ex: knee joint) let it dry, then air heat the legs, attach knee and pin it back.*==

When I mod Venom I want to document it as a tutorial for future reference. I'll take photos and clips (need to buy tripod in [[Wishlist]]) at different stages e.g., comparing Venom to Maximum Spider-Man and showing from various angles how their different approach to butterfly joints affects their range of motion, showing how I plan and then modify the body, showing images of what my ideas for the figure are.
Then I can include images of the figure before and after doing various poses, to show the effect of the articulation mods. Should credit any images used that aren't mine and credit any tutorials that inspired me such as the Cyclops butterfly mod above.
Also note that at the start of the tutorial I'm gonna act like I'm throwing away Captain America, then at the end I'll show my Venomized Captain America next to my custom Venom and other figures.

I have already black and white (ordered with ML Spidey custom head).
- Magneto has arms and hands perfect for Batman. So I will ==saw off X-Cutioner's forearms (at the highest strap) and saw off Magneto's forearms to stick them on with M2 screws for swivel.== I will also do the same for the legs, ==sawing off the X-Cutioner's calves at the highest strap and screwing them onto Magneto's legs for swivel and added musculature and detail.== Also note that I need to ==remove the kneepads on the X-Cutioner calves== and smooth that area after removing it.
- I'm going to use the ball-joint set to ==add a ball-joint waist to the Magneto body.== Following DangITProductions' Wolverine mod video, I'll install carve out the waist-piece and round out the rim of the abdomen piece, then install the connector piece into the abdomen piece and install the joint into the hip-piece using a paperclip.
- I need to ==get rid of the lettering on X-Cutioner's belt== and then the big one - ==shave off the details of his head and sculpt on ears and a "nose". (Reference the last image above.)==
- I also need to ==add toe-articulation (following the tutorial) and cover up the metal rod with putty to maintain the sculpt.==
- Make sure that you ==sand from harsher to softer grits of sandpaper when sanding out the details on the head and smoothing the sculpted ears onto his head.==
- I need to also recreate the neck structure on the X-Cutioner body onto the Magneto body. I can use the same method as I do for adding a ball-joint waist, ==installing a joint connector in the head/neck piece and install a joint via paperclip in the torso (after dremeling it a bit to mimic the torso structure of the X-Cutioner body).==
- After all this, I can ==dye the figure with Rit Synthetic Dye,== at that point I can ==paint the majority of the body grey with the yellow utility belt and black gauntlets and boots plus his white eyes.==
- I can follow the Spider-logo tutorial to make the Bat logo painting easier also.
- At this point the sculpt and painting is done on all fronts, I can now ==use my Loctite super glue to adhere the cape to the ridge of the neck cavity for a clean transition. Make sure to check how the cape fits around the neck before gluing!!==
- Also I want to ==install some magnets into the feet.==
Should document the process of this one too!

I like my Monster Venom Deluxe but I want a more poseable, bigger Venom! I already have black paint, black dye, white paint, red paint and various other tools from various other purchases/customs.
- First I would ==sand down all the harsh details on the body, the boot rims, the sole of the boots, the grainy texture on the abdomen + sanding down the rim of the abdomen to avoid paint rub later, the bicep cuffs and the bracelets on the arms.==
- I also would want to ==get rid of the cuffs on the multiple hands in the same way (The cuffs on the fists are removable so I should smooth out the hands with them removed).==
- I want to ==do a similar butterfly mod that I'm doing to Gamerverse Venom (reference above) as the shoulders have no forward range.==
- The knees and arms are single-jointed, but can definitely reach more range so I ==need to take them out and carve out some plastic with an exacto knife.==
- I want to give the body a more V-taper like Monster Venom, but narrowing the waist is not the way to go. Normally bigger Venom appearances bulk up towards the top, the lower body is fine but we need bigger upper body. The trap muscles are very lacking (and for good reason), so I will ==use epoxy putty to re-sculpt the trap muscles to look like those on the ML Monster Venom Deluxe (images seen above).== The traps need to eclipse the original head, peaking lightly below it. My idea is that, after removing the facial details (because the head inside the helmet is a separate piece) for good measure, I will ==glue the head tight so it cannot move and sculpt around it to create those big traps.== While sculpting I can move around and re-sculpt parts to achieve that musculature that the Deluxe Monster Venom has, alongside that I need to ==sculpt the traps to point forward and sculpt a neck that transitions into the chest== the same way the Deluxe Monster Venom is sculpted. I will then ==use the ball joint set to replace the original neck articulation== when I finish my modified torso sculpt.
- I'm going to use the head from my Deluxe Monster Venom for this custom, I just need to repaint it after I dye everything.
- The feet are still a bit big even if I remove the soles, and the width would affect the articulation if I modify it, so I'll ==just sand down the toes to a pointy shape so that it has a more classic design.==
- I also want to ==drill some holes into the fists== for fitting webs, alongside this I need to ==use epoxy putty to add longer claw-like fingers to the hands.==
- I also want to add a ball-joint waist, following DangITProductions' example, I'll slightly ==hollow out the crotchpiece and round out the abdomen piece, creating a recess to install the ball joint.==
- At this point, the whole sculpt is finished. I can ==dye the figure and its accessories black, then paint on the symbols and patches== etc etc as I did on the Gamerverse Venom. I want to copy the symbol from the 12in Spider-Man figure.
- The custom is basically finished, but I could also ==shade the figure using a drybrush of dark prussian blue.==

Pretty simple kitbash. Just need to do the following:
- ==Remove the belt, leg strap and head from the ML.== I need to put some glue inside the ML head so that I can make it fit on the Revoltech neck joint.
- ==Remove the right viewer's side arm on the CT and replace it with the AC Factory arm.== I also want to remove the shoulder-guard from the ML cyborg arm and glue it onto the Revoltech arm. The difference in finish is fine as the arm appeared with different materials in the comic to begin with.
- Using my paint brushes and Micron pens, ==cel shade the blue sections of the figure.== Follow the reference images above, it's mostly black but the musculature is outlined blue.
- After all this is done I want to ==matte finish the figure.==
