- I already have Vallejo white so that's sorted. I would just need to get rid of the scarf and resculpt the head a bit to have a masked look with no mouth detail, alongside shaving off the mask and eyes.
- From there I just have to repaint the whole thing in metallic red, paint the fingers, spider symbol and lenses on with white and then repaint the hair.
- Also need to add toe articulation and do the [[ML Ab-Crunch mod]].

- Do the [[ML Ab-Crunch mod]] on this figure.
- I want to increase the forward-shoulder range, so I'm going to attempt to adapt this mod. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoviqGwjY5s
- If the inner structure of the shoulders is similar to the Vulcan body I will carve out the front gap of the shoulders for more forward-range, alongside the actual inner-tract of the shoulder joints.
- I'm also gonna repaint these Marvel Select heads + the Marvel Select's "backpack" accessory with all its tendrils + dremel out the joints on the Select hands and mod it with some odd joints from AliExpress. 
- I'm also gonna paint out the legs of the spider-symbol and round out the body, then add new legs based on the 12in design.
- Also add boot swivel using screws!
- *Heat up the fig with a hairdryer, pop the pins, 1-2 layer of super glue on both sides of joint (ex: knee joint) let it dry, then air heat the legs, attach knee and pin it back.*

When I mod Venom I want to document it as a tutorial for future reference. I'll take photos and clips (need to buy tripod in [[Wishlist]]) at different stages e.g., comparing Venom to Maximum Spider-Man and showing from various angles how their different approach to butterfly joints affects their range of motion, showing how I plan and then modify the body, showing images of what my ideas for the figure are.
Then I can include images of the figure before and after doing various poses, to show the effect of the articulation mods. Should credit any images used that aren't mine and credit any tutorials that inspired me such as the Cyclops butterfly mod above.
Also note that at the start of the tutorial I'm gonna act like I'm throwing away Captain America, then at the end I'll show my Venomized Captain America next to my custom Venom and other figures.

Marvel Legends Maximum-er Spider-Man:
- I already have the right red, blue and black paints I need to repaint the logos on Maximum Spider-Man. Would just need to paint the legs over then reshape the body of the spider, then add the new legs and repaint the webs after drying. 
- The regular spider-logo is up top and smaller so it spreads across the shoulder-blades, whereas this logo is bigger and more central to the back so when I repaint it I can just spread it across the upper and lower body, which means I'd probably need to sand the abdomen down a bit to prevent paint rub. I want to do shorter legs than WOS or Toybiz though.
- Also note that I should do this repaint after I do the [[ML Ab-Crunch mod]].
- This would be similar to how the spider-logo is done on the Toybiz Spider-Man body.
I'll probably do these mods in January considering I won't get the custom headsculpt until then.

Marvel Legends Venomized Captain America:
[Rit Synthetic Dye](https://amzn.eu/d/7xY5K0Q) 8.49
when I buy the Gamerverse Venom two pack,I could Venomize the Captain America included instead of throwing it away. There is already a figure of this but it uses a darker colour scheme and uses the scaled design for the Captain's suit.
Here I would sculpt over some areas, e.g., the right foot or the left hands with their extra long nails, the head. Specifically, I would sand down or sculpt over the shield and repaint it to look like the symbiote shield that Venom has in MvC, with tendrils floating off the sides too!
I'd want to mimic the art by Patrick Brown with how one of the legs one of the arms are mid-transformation, so I would sculpt tendrils around those areas (maybe make them pluggable as to reduce breakage and make articulation smoother? Include multiple points of entry).
Note that the red on the abdomen and gloves/boots needs to be painted over (aside from the aforementioned mid-transformed areas) so I may need to sand down some areas to avoid paint rub.
I could also shave down the cuffs on the arms and boots to add symbiote texturing like in Patrick Brown's art.
Also note, if I want to add a jaw with teeth and a big tongue I should saw off the head from the nose down and then resculpt the lower half of the head into a Venomized jaw with teeth and tongue alongside sculpting the top half of the head to have teeth and a lip (alongside the rest of the design on the head) before attaching with super glue and painting.
I want to dye the figure black, so I'll do that after finishing all the re-sculpting so that all the details are coloured already. After I just need to repaint the glove, boot and white areas.
I have all the paints needed already.

I have already black and white (ordered with ML Spidey custom head), black dye from the Captain America custom.
- Magneto has the arms and hands perfect for Batman. So I will saw off X-Cutioner's forearms (at the highest strap) and saw off Magneto's forearms to stick them on with M2 screws for swivel. I will also do the same for the legs, sawing off 
- X-Cutioner's calves at the highest strap and screwing them onto Magneto's legs for swivel and added musculature and detail. Also note that I need to remove the kneepads on the X-Cutioner calves and smooth that area after removing it.
- I also want to retain the X-Cutioner's crotch-piece for its ball-joint waist. So I need to round the lower rim of Magneto's body, but also form a crater from the bottom with a female connector for the waist joint seated inside. This will allow for smooth movement in the same way MAFEX bodies approach waist movement.
- I need to get rid of the lettering on X-Cutioner's belt and then the big one - shave off the details of his head and sculpt on ears and a "nose". (Reference the last image above.)
- I also need to add toe-articulation (following the tutorial) and cover up the metal rod with putty to maintain the sculpt.
- Make sure that you sand from harsher to softer grits of sandpaper when sanding out the details on the head and smoothing the sculpted ears onto his head. 
- I need to also recreate the neck structure on the X-Cutioner body onto the Magneto body. My best bet is to saw off the area with the neck joint and imitate its cavity on the Magneto figure - then I can super glue the neck joint itself onto the Magneto body's neck cavity.
- After all this, I can dye the figure with Rit Synthetic Dye, at that point I can paint the majority of the body grey with the yellow utility belt and black gauntlets and boots plus his white eyes.
- I can follow the Spider-logo tutorial to make the Bat logo painting easier also.
- At this point the sculpt and painting is done on all fronts, I can now use my Loctite super glue to adhere the cape to the ridge of the neck cavity for a clean transition. Make sure to check how the cape fits around the neck before gluing!!
- Also I can sculpt some batarangs.
Should document the process of this one too!
