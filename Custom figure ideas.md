Pretty simple kitbash. Just need to do the following:
- ==Remove the belt, leg strap and head from the ML.== I need to put some glue inside the ML head so that I can make it fit on the Revoltech neck joint.
- ==Remove the right viewer's side arm on the CT and replace it with the AC Factory arm.== I also want to remove the shoulder-guard from the ML cyborg arm and glue it onto the Revoltech arm. The difference in finish is fine as the arm appeared with different materials in the comic to begin with.
- Using my paint brushes and Micron pens, ==cel shade the blue sections of the figure.== Follow the reference images above, it's mostly black but the musculature is outlined blue.
- After all this is done I want to ==matte finish the figure.==
