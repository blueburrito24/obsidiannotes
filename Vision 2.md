I'm walking through my corridor and I peep through the doorway to my front.
There she is. I heard her giggling before I came.
"I found a trick to stay up on one leg while asleep and I've been doing it for a while now!"
I giggle a bit too and lead her to my room, we lay together in my bed.
I ask her,
"Why won't you love me?"
"Your hands..."
She looks away and her voice crumples, my hands shrink into my sleeves too.
"It's fine." I affirm to her, and I carry her back to her room.
When will the clock strike for me?

I remember thinking while she left, she has such a snowy complexion.
I've been shivering ever since I woke up.
