- I will sand off the spider logos and sculpt the 2099 patterns and insignia onto the body.
- I will use a mix of Vallejo dark Prussian blue and black to match the body with the mafex 2099 ko parts, but will also mix it with metal medium to give it that flair.
- I will use my Vallejo vermillion red mixed with metal medium for the red sections.
- I then need to dremel in holes for the web-capes.
- Then I need to dye all the joints black, using the dye I bought for Spider-Man Noir. Although the body is a reflective blue, it's dark so black joints will fit better than blue.
- I can recast the fahrulstore35 V55 headsculpt and resculpt it to feature the large eyes seen on KIISUCreations' 2099 headsculpt. I would sand down the eyes from the inside and add the details, so that the eyes transition into the blue areas. The large head will fit well with my other Revoltechs.
I can keep the unused parts for fodder, since I have other Revoltech figures and loose parts from various customs that I can kitbash with.
