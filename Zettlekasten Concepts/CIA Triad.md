# CIA Triad

## 1. Simple Explanation (Feynman Technique)
> The "CIA Triad" is a group of three parts of how we protect something we have. This includes "confidentiality" who can use it, "integrity" only we can write on it, and "availability" can we use it?
> Like if you have a bunch of books you like, you keep them safe with a box to store them in and you use bookmarks to keep check of where you're reading.
> If you write anything on the book, you want to make sure you can still read the book!

## 2. Technical Details
- **The CIA Triad consists of confidentiality, integrity and availability.**
- [[Confidentiality]] refers to who can access our information.
- [[Integrity]] refers to the status of the information. Information needs to be precise, accurate and only changed when we want it to be changed!
- [[Availability]] refers to the fact that the authorised party should be able to access the information when they need to.
These three can be considered the key goals of information security.
