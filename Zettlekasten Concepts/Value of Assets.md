# Value of Assets

## 1. Simple Explanation (Feynman Technique)
> How much do you like your room? If you like it a lot, then it has a high value - and your room is something you use, so it's an "asset".

## 2. Technical Details
- **The value of our assets is crucial to determining what level of security we should use on them.**
- Different assets need different forms or levels of protection.
- Value of assets derives from purpose and perspective; if an asset is costly to replace (bespoke) then it deserves a lot of protection, whereas an asset that's easily replaceable (off-the-shelf) can be left with lesser security measures. 
- Value of assets can also derive from sentimental value, like a photo of a hangout with friends, or derive from time-sensitivity, like a build of a closed-source program before its made open-source.
- "Risk management" refers to when we compare the gravity of harm to an asset and our ability to protect the asset. This is an important component of measuring asset value and its proportional level of security.
