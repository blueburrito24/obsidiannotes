# Threats

## 1. Simple Explanation (Feynman Technique)
> Threats are things that can mess up the stuff you like. If your bedroom door's lock is broken, a threat is that someone could go into your room when you're not there and take your books.

## 2. Technical Details
- **Threats are scenarios where loss and harm can occur to an asset.**
- Threats can come from both human and non-human sources, such as employees breaching software confidentiality or hardware failures. [[WAR70]] was a stepping stone in identifying such traits of Information Security.
- While "threats" refer to potential causes of harm, [[Attacks]] refer to malicious and explicit harm.
- There are also different types of threats, like [[Cyberthreats]] and [[Advanced Persistent Threats]].
