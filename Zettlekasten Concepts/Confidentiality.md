# Confidentiality

## 1. Simple Explanation (Feynman Technique)
> Confidentiality is who we want to be able to use something. 
> If you have a family laptop, you only want the people in your family to use it like your parents or your siblings. If you don't want someone else, like a friend coming over or a guest, to use the laptop then you need to create confidentiality in who can use it.
