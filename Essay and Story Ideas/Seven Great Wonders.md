**I'd like to make my own little e-reader app that reads my comic, i can release it on my website**
It would let you flip through each page of an issue, issues are separated by folders and each page is an image file
you can save where you last read and all those good features
the comics would be in folders organised by comic/issue/page so i can use the program to read any comic I make

Less significant but relevant notes:
- I think the technological aspects and scope should be defined through visuals e.g., we see advanced vehicles and different species in the background
- each issue cover is a photograph from their time there, whether it's them at a restaurant or doing yoga or running away from bandits, whatever! then at the end of the comic, the final image is a wall of these photos with them drinking tea together
- could feature races and even characters from Handsign for building scope
- I need to define how the two characters become closer through out the story. Is it conflict? Is it just them getting to know each other? Is it knowing that they can rely on each other?
- I should draw up a world map with all the important and even irrelevant pieces of this story, maybe they will use it to plan the trip!
## Blue and Yellow's dynamic is based on goals; 
Blue knows she wants to explore and get out of her typical life, Yellow has never had distinct aspirations and is thrown into Blue's shenanigans; through the events of the story Yellow sees the meaning of home and what it means for the people they meet and decides he wants to settle down with Blue and do some new, albeit smaller, things with his life
## "I've always liked the number 7, so we'll visit 7 great wonders!"
- great kingdom under the sea
(stopping a big bully who's pushing over the people of the kingdom while the king is away on business, **learning to understand our neighbours**)
- planetary system above the stars
(stopping an argument between leaders of rival alien clans, who happen to be siblings, **finding solace in those close to us**)
- secluded town far out in the country
(figuring out the mystery of a serial kidnapper, **learning that two heads are better than one, against any odds**)
- rustic castle atop a great mountain, with an unimaginable library of books that'll suck you right in
(trying to escape from these cursed books, **finding a greater appreciation for the status quo**)
- a seemingly abandoned military camp in the arctic
(running into ghosts and furmaids, running around in fear but eventually finding solid ground with them, **realising that even when thrown in a bad situation, we should make the best of it**)
- the tallest boat-hotel in the world
(fending off the boat-hotel from pirates, **defending what you love from those who don't love it**)
- the deep dark caves of their own home town
(looking around where they started and looking forward to what they might face, **thinking ahead of what life might throw your way**)
