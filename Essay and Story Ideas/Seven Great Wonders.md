**I'd like to make my own little e-reader app that reads my comic, i can release it on my website**
It would let you flip through each page of an issue, issues are separated by folders and each page is an image file
you can save where you last read and all those good features
the comics would be in folders organised by comic/issue/page so i can use the program to read any comic I make

Less significant but relevant notes:
- I think the technological aspects and scope should be defined through visuals e.g., we see advanced vehicles and different species in the background, people still use flip-phones though and there's even people that hold them from the top!
- each issue cover is a photograph from their time there, whether it's them at a restaurant or doing yoga or running away from bandits, whatever! then at the end of the comic, the final image is a wall of these photos with them drinking tea together
- could feature races and even characters from Handsign for building scope
- I need to define how the two characters become closer through out the story. Is it conflict? Is it just them getting to know each other? Is it knowing that they can rely on each other?
- I should draw up a world map with all the important and even irrelevant pieces of this story, maybe they will use it to plan the trip!
- There should be a mermaid in the ghost camp who greets the group upon arrival, her hair is always in twin tails and nobody knows why--- later at the end of the saga its revealed one of the ghost soldiers who loved the mermaid in his past life is always on her back holding her twin tails up high! He drives her like a motorcycle across the sea!!!
## Blue and Yellow's dynamic is based on goals; 
Blue knows she wants to explore and get out of her typical life, Yellow has never had distinct aspirations and is thrown into Blue's shenanigans; through the events of the story Yellow sees the meaning of home and what it means for the people they meet and decides he wants to settle down with Blue and do some new, albeit smaller, things with his life
## "I've always liked the number 7, so we'll visit 7 great wonders!"
- great kingdom under the sea
(stopping a big bully who's pushing over the people of the kingdom while the king is away on business, **learning to understand our neighbours**)
     - Deep Sea Kingdom runs under a fish-eat-fish system. Big fish eat small fish.
- planetary system above the stars
(stopping an argument between leaders of rival alien clans, who happen to be siblings, **finding solace in those close to us**)
- secluded town far out in the country
(figuring out the mystery of a serial kidnapper, **learning that two heads are better than one, against any odds**)
- rustic castle atop a great mountain, with an unimaginable library of books that'll suck you right in
(trying to escape from these cursed books, **finding a greater appreciation for the status quo**)
- a seemingly abandoned military camp in the arctic
(running into ghosts and furmaids, running around in fear but eventually finding solid ground with them, **realising that even when thrown in a bad situation, we should make the best of it**)
- the tallest boat-hotel in the world
(fending off the boat-hotel from pirates, **defending what you love from those who don't love it**)
- the deep dark caves of their own home town
(looking around where they started and looking forward to what they might face, **thinking ahead of what life might throw your way**)
## Issue 1
Blue retells her boring life+
(worked a boring job, saved up a ton but didn't know what to do with it, didn't hang around many people, never does what she likes but what's "best*)
She walks up to her everyday cafe and thinks, "I know! I'll marry the first guy I see, that'll be interesting..." and sees a scary looking guy, Yellow+
She sits in front of Yellow while he's mid-bite in a pancake, looks him dead in the eyes and says "Let me be your partner!"
## Issue 2
Yellow freaks out at the idea of such an abrupt change and urges they get to know each other first+
Yellow, both reluctant and weirdly interested, takes her to a register office to get their marriage license sorted+
(Blue pulls him aside to a local cultural clothing place and dresses herself in South Asian clothing and Yellow in Chinese clothing. The scene in the office is an abrupt and funny frame.)
Blue also gets their boating licenses and space-travel licenses sorted, before dropping her travel plans on Yellow out of nowhere!
(in the previous panels you can see her looking at the different license posters while Yellow is getting the marriage license sorted.)
Blue burns down her old house to push herself into this exploration trip+
(burning house scene i came up with before)
They finalise their packing and leave for their first adventure+

# Sideplots:
## The Lull Kingdom of Vitalae
- while journeying from one kingdom to another Blue and Yellow need a place to get some proper rest, they see a broken down sign to a smaller kingdom and think that, at worst, they can take up this abandoned town and rest up, so they follow the sign
- they find that the kingdom is live and well, welcomed by a local librarian, they get to rest and enjoy the local entertainment for the day
- the sun sets at 7pm and everyone in town goes to sleep immediately, Blue and Yellow planned to sleep later however
- a tall, rustic machine stands over their cabin and launches a hard fist into it!
- both are unscathed, but Blue is left in a deep sleep from the impact and can't be awoken
- Yellow runs off to the local librarian they met earlier and wakes him up to find out what's happening
- the librarian dusts off a fairly old book and recounts how the old king from 30 years ago sought out for his kingdom's health and gathered various scientists to produce large robots to help the people of the kingdom.
- these robots helped water crops and built shelter, but were also made to help the people get good rest too; on the first day of activation their parameters for this function were set incorrectly and instead of calmly putting everyone to rest, the robots put the people to rest with heavy hands (albeit to the same result)
- the king stayed up late to try and work out how to fix it, but he forgot that he too would be put to sleep; the impact did not hurt him initially but it blasted the castle with him inside outside the kingdom and its barrier
- the sleep enacted by the robots only lasts for the night, however if you leave the barrier of the kingdom you cannot wake; this was a safety function to ensure easy rescue if someone is captured from the kingdom
- the librarian and Yellow have to quietly search through the library for any documentation on the robots and how their functions are set, so they can re-calibrate them and ensure proper peace in the kingdom.
