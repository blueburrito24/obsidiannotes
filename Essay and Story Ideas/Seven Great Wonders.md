Would be cool to run a tiktok about my comic after I've finished 5 issues where I discuss my series, drop late posts of chapter content, give bts content, etc
Post my comic on Webtoon CANVAS.

Less significant but relevant notes:
- I think the technological aspects and scope should be defined through visuals e.g., we see advanced vehicles and different species in the background, people still use flip-phones though and there's even people that hold them from the top!
- each issue cover is a photograph from their time there, whether it's them at a restaurant or doing yoga or running away from bandits, whatever! then at the end of the comic, the final image is a wall of these photos with them drinking tea together
- could feature races and even characters from Handsign for building scope
- I need to define how the two characters become closer through out the story. Is it conflict? Is it just them getting to know each other? Is it knowing that they can rely on each other?
- I should draw up a world map with all the important and even irrelevant pieces of this story, maybe they will use it to plan the trip!
- There should be a mermaid in the ghost camp who greets the group upon arrival, her hair is always in twin tails and nobody knows why--- later at the end of the saga its revealed one of the ghost soldiers who loved the mermaid in his past life is always on her back holding her twin tails up high! He drives her like a motorcycle across the sea!!!
- Blue and Yellow's dynamic is based on their goals;
Blue knows she wants to explore and get out of her typical life, Yellow has never had distinct aspirations and is thrown into Blue's shenanigans; through the events of the story Yellow sees the meaning of home and what it means for the people they meet and decides he wants to settle down with Blue and do some new, albeit smaller, things with his life
- I want to draw panels like pre-timeskip Oda, omitting unnecessary details and controlling the scope of what viewers take in with each panel!
# "I've always liked the number 7, so we'll visit 7 great wonders!"
### Deep Sea Kingdom (Not Finished)
While getting her boat license sorted, Blue reads up on various sights to see around the nearby seas and takes note of a seldom-mentioned place called "The Deep Sea".
After getting the boat license, Blue rents out a boat for her and Yellow to ride into The Deep Sea.
They ogle at all the strange creatures they see around in the water, and eventually find themselves at a dock at the Deep Sea!?
It appears that the Deep Sea is actually a Kingdom deep under Diamond Trail!
They're welcomed at the dock by the daughter of the dock's owner, Bellabella, and she accompanies them to the nearby town for their sightseeing.
(Need to figure out what conflict they face here and how/why they go to the next "wonder").
### Planet (Not Finished)
- planetary system above the stars
(stopping an argument between leaders of rival alien clans, who happen to be siblings, **finding solace in those close to us**)
- I want some mention of the planet from [[HANDSIGN]] where the predator Antax race is from.
### Veral Vine Kingdom
One of the incredible landmarks Blue spots in a magazine is the tallest mountain known to man - Great Gray Mountain - huddled deep in a jungle far-off from Blue and Yellow's home town of Diamond Trail.
They pack their bags with mountain climbing gear and head off for the jungle, wanting to see the view from the peak of the mountain.
Deep in the jungle, they see at the bottom of the mountain there is a large, bustling town! This is Veral Vine Kingdom, a land cut off from the rest of the world despite its next-door landmark!
The people of the kingdom welcome Blue and Yellow, with the local lodge owner Barakim letting them stay before they head up the mountain.
In the days they stay at the mountain, they enjoy the local scenery and culture but are often annoyed by two local mischiefs - Satara and Vimchen, a brown and grayish monkey pair that infamously bothers the locals.
Yellow is put off by these two and wants to tell them off, but Barakim pulls him and Blue back and tells them about why the townsfolk aren't too bothered by the pair.

Their pranks are annoying but relatively harmless, but also the townsfolk fester a deep secret to where the pair came from.
20 years ago, a great gray beast terrorised the town from atop the famous landmark at the end of the jungle, from which the mountain got its name.
The gray beast stole food and broke houses, until Akim, a warrior from a far-off land called Baron Round Island, had came for rest and decided he would handle the beast.
Through a long and desperate battle, Akim lost his leg but was able to slice down the great beast in two! But unforeseen, after this battle the beast had shed much fur and in the wake of the battle, two small monkeys were found in a bed of the beast's fur. Nobody could figure out why this had happened, but Akim had decided that these two children needed shelter above all else, so he asked the townsfolk to take care of them. Nobody had seen Akim after this incident.

The next day, Blue and Yellow set off for the mountain, accompanied by Satara and Vimchen who were oddly set on getting to the mountain too.
Intrigued by what the lodge owner told them, Yellow asks the two where they're from as he's only seen them messing around all over the town.
The two retell how they grew up in a now-closed bar on the far side of the town, many townsfolk would rush to the bar and shout for the two monkeys to be sent off away from the town, but the bar owner Barakim always protected them from the townsfolk that persecuted them.

Upon reaching the top of the mountain, and taking a few photos of the view, the bubble of travellers notice a small lodge on the side of the mountain.
They go in to find nobody there, but a small shelf of books and a tableside with a mug left on it.
They dig into the books to find various photos of the two monkeys in the town, alongside the bar, now lodge owner, Barakim with them.
There's also a lot of scenic photos of the town from the jungle, with the mountain visible, Blue takes notice of a large figure in the mountains in these photos.

The bubble of travellers prepare to leave and go their separate ways, and then the door is slammed open by Barakim!
Everyone is confused as to why Barakim is up on the mountain, to which he explains that he's raised Satara and Vimchen since they were babies, he would often retreat with them to the mountain when some townsfolk would get rowdy about their staying at the town.
Blue asks why, alongside why there's photos with the old gray beast in them on the shelf.
Barakim then reveals that he is the same warrior that stopped the beast, Akim, only adding "bar" to his name when he opened up his old bar at the far side of the town! (This would be a joke panel).
Well before his arrival at the town, Barakim was a renowned knight on Baron Round Island and often brought back endangered wildlife from his ventures to the island. Upon his retirement as a knight, he ventured out and decided that this jungle would be the perfect place to let his family of animals roam free - many of these animals were intelligent and were predecessors to the townsfolk of Veral Vine Kingdom.
He appointed his favourite monkey, Sacchan, as the leader of all the animals that lived in the jungle, Sacchan was the most intelligent and loved all the animals just as Akim did.
Upon his revisiting years later, Akim had found that Sacchan had been having a breakdown at the top of the mountain. The townsfolk saw it as a rampage, but Akim knew Sacchan well and knew something was of danger to her.
When he went to confront Sacchan, the monkey prompted him to end her life.
At first confused and refusing to, Akim noticed Sacchan's eyes were a deep shade of red - this made Akim aware that she was sick and had no solution to her problem.
Upon putting her life to its end, Akim found the two children in a bed of her fur near the mountain, warding off the scared and somewhat violent townsfolk he knew that these two were Sacchan's children and that they needed to be taken care of in her absence. Akim opened up a bar at the end of the town so that the two had somewhere to stay, and that he could be something of use to the townsfolk after this ordeal.

Also he makes note of rumours around their birth, since he wasn't there for it he couldn't decide what really happened, but many theorise that the two monkeys were in fact the original Sacchan split into two new bodies.
He thinks back to the encyclopedia he kept at his home on Baron Round Island - there has never been any documents on how Sacchan's sub-species of ape reproduces...

Barakim sits with his two children and recommends Blue and Yellow to visit Baron Round Island for him. (This bit needs some work).
### Baron Round Island/the Bun Boyage Incident (Not Finished)
- Upon Barakim's recommendation, and seeing the Bun Boyage cabin cruiser in a local magazine, Blue prompts that she and Yellow go on the Bun Boyage to visit Baron Round Island, from which they can also send Barakim a postcard!
- Pirates invade the boat mid-trip (need to finish writing this story).
### Other/Unfinished
- the deep dark caves of their own home town
(looking around where they started and looking forward to what they might face, **thinking ahead of what life might throw your way**)
# Issue 1
Blue retells her boring life+
(worked a boring job, saved up a ton but didn't know what to do with it, didn't hang around many people, never does what she likes but what's "best*)
She walks up to her everyday cafe and thinks, "I know! I'll marry the first guy I see, that'll be interesting..." and sees a scary looking guy, Yellow+
She sits in front of Yellow while he's mid-bite in a pancake, looks him dead in the eyes and says "Let me be your partner!"
# Issue 2
Yellow freaks out at the idea of such an abrupt change and urges they get to know each other first+
Yellow, both reluctant and weirdly interested, takes her to a register office to get their marriage license sorted+
(Blue pulls him aside to a local cultural clothing place and dresses herself in South Asian clothing and Yellow in Chinese clothing. The scene in the office is an abrupt and funny frame.)
Blue also gets their boating licenses and space-travel licenses sorted, before dropping her travel plans on Yellow out of nowhere!
(in the previous panels you can see her looking at the different license posters while Yellow is getting the marriage license sorted.)
Blue burns down her old house to push herself into this exploration trip+
(burning house scene i came up with before)
They finalise their packing and leave for their first adventure+
# Sideplots:
### The Lull Kingdom of Vitalae
- while journeying from one kingdom to another Blue and Yellow need a place to get some proper rest, they see a broken down sign to a smaller kingdom and think that, at worst, they can take up this abandoned town and rest up, so they follow the sign
- they find that the kingdom is live and well, welcomed by a local librarian, they get to rest and enjoy the local entertainment for the day
- the sun sets at 7pm and everyone in town goes to sleep immediately, Blue and Yellow planned to sleep later however
- a tall, rustic machine stands over their cabin and launches a hard fist into it!
- both are unscathed, but Blue is left in a deep sleep from the impact and can't be awoken
- Yellow runs off to the local librarian they met earlier and wakes him up to find out what's happening
- the librarian dusts off a fairly old book and recounts how the old king from 30 years ago sought out for his kingdom's health and gathered various scientists to produce large robots to help the people of the kingdom.
- these robots helped water crops and built shelter, but were also made to help the people get good rest too; on the first day of activation their parameters for this function were set incorrectly and instead of calmly putting everyone to rest, the robots put the people to rest with heavy hands (albeit to the same result)
- the king stayed up late to try and work out how to fix it, but he forgot that he too would be put to sleep; the impact did not hurt him initially but it blasted the castle with him inside outside the kingdom and its barrier
- the sleep enacted by the robots only lasts for the night, however if you leave the barrier of the kingdom you cannot wake; this was a safety function to ensure easy rescue if someone is captured from the kingdom
- the librarian and Yellow have to quietly search through the library for any documentation on the robots and how their functions are set, so they can re-calibrate them and ensure proper peace in the kingdom.
### Skull Shore Camp (Unfinished)
- a seemingly abandoned military camp in the arctic
(running into ghosts and furmaids, running around in fear but eventually finding solid ground with them, **realising that even when thrown in a bad situation, we should make the best of it**)
