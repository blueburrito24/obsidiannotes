Idea for YT intro:
entirely silhouetted. blue venom chasing red spider-man through the sky and spider-man flips around to attack, as does venom. then it freeze frames and they both morph into two flipped Bs for blueburrito, then an overlay of a web effect zooming in and out plays to transition to the actual video with some ps1 spider-man effects.

Until I've gotten deep into OOP, I'm gonna study [Bro Code's DSA course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYHwZcbD-s) alongside ["Learn Java in 14 Minutes"](https://youtu.be/RRubcjpTkks?si=DDYNgi3O2u8jJ5um) and [“Java OOP in 10 minutes”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWYv7xlKydw) so that I can actively keep up with the DSA course while building on my foundation.
