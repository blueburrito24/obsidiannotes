crazy perspective piece based on triforce films' rendition of fist bump, with shots of sonic and tails running around and stomping eggman's bots with lyrics overlaid on top

character piece of sonic unleashed based on triforce films' rendition of endless possibilities, with shots of sonic transformed and posed up in the sky too - representing light and dark gaia!

piece line-up of all the famous kamehamehas! goku, ryu, gohan, sonic, akuma, whoever and whatever! to the tune of smooth mcgroove's cover of milf from fnf!
