study the ai module’s python exercises in google colab, study head first java \+ ask claude for basic java exercises. Look into fib programs and factorial calculators.  
Go over them alex lee videos again… practice stuff with scanners and while loops  
Look into Manim for python animation \-\> helps learn maths and make cool animations, but this is for later when i’m deep into the coding shebang.

install Kanban board plugin
start using Anki for CS flashcards (also would be good for Arabic and maybe driving theory)
Set up bitwarden

Design a Venomised Captain America. White eyes, sharp A, harsh blue shading and a shield that screams corrupt. Lots of tendrils and teeth. Take inspo from WoS.

Idea for YT intro:
entirely silhouetted. blue venom chasing red spider-man through the sky and spider-man flips around to attack, as does venom. then it freeze frames and they both morph into two flipped Bs for blueburrito, then an overlay of a web effect zooming in and out plays to transition to the actual video with some ps1 spider-man effects.

Read Obsidian documentation.

Until I've gotten deep into OOP, I'm gonna study [Bro Code's DSA course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYHwZcbD-s) alongside ["Learn Java in 14 Minutes"](https://youtu.be/RRubcjpTkks?si=DDYNgi3O2u8jJ5um) and [“Java OOP in 10 minutes”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWYv7xlKydw) so that I can actively keep up with the DSA course while building on my foundation.
Study Weeks 1-4 for the Quiz on this Friday.

Study normally as the classes go along, reliant on Python but they will go through it.
Do python exercises, including personal works and keep up with lessons. Need to go through Week 4. Work on Labs 2 and 3.
Read Numpy documentation.

***SOFTWARE ENGINEERING***  
Study normally, they go over the concepts you need to learn.
Currently need to go over [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9v10jQkm5c) and Week 4 lesson.

***TEAM PROJECT*** e.g., [[Team Placement Notes and Temp Docs]]
Actively work on with colleagues. [[Team Placement Notes and Temp Docs]]
