description: "THE TRANSFORMERS JOIN THE ENERGON UNIVERSE! Optimus Prime was supposed to have led the Autobots to victory. Instead, the fate of Cybertron is unknown, and his allies have crash-landed far from home, alongside their enemies—the Decepticons. As these titanic forces renew their war on Earth, one thing is immediately clear: the planet will never be the same. New alliances are struck. Battle lines are redrawn. And humanity’s only hope of survival is Optimus Prime. Superstar creator Daniel Warren Johnson (Do a Powerbomb, Wonder Woman: Dead Earth), alongside showrunner Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead, Invincible), reimagines Hasbro’s robots in disguise for a brand-new generation. Collects TRANSFORMERS #1-6"
