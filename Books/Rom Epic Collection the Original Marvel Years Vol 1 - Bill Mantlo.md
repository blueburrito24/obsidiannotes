description: "Continuing the complete collection of Rom's classic adventures in the Marvel Universe! The female Dire Wraiths hiding in Earth's midst are even more deadly than the males, and now they're taking charge of the invasion! That's bad news for Rom, who is still coming to terms with Brandy Clark's transformation into the golden Spaceknight Starfire! But it might be even worse for the super hero known as Torpedo! Tensions mount further when a crew of Skrulls arrive with their own vendetta against the Dire Wraiths! It's a good thing Rom has allies in his noble fight -- including Ant-Man, Alpha Flight and the New Mutants! But when the Spaceknight meets the Incredible Hulk at last, what impact will Rom's Neutralizer have on the rampaging jade giant? COLLECTING: Rom (1979) #48-60, Rom Annual (1982) #3, Incredible Hulk (1968) #296"
