description: "In the future, a cold and hostile Manhattan has long ago traded freedom for security, imposed by the brutal soldiers of the Reign. Can Peter Parker rediscover his once-great power and responsibility? Or is the Spider's mask too heavy a burden to bear in this harsh new reality? Plus, what fresh tragedies and triumphs await this older, grizzled Peter Parker? And who is the new Black Cat?! Meanwhile, Peter isn't the only one who aged. Wait until you see what happened to Miles Morales! But when Old Man Peter has the chance to go back to the past, can he save the future - and, more important, Mary Jane? Not if Miles has anything to say about it! Collecting, Spider-Man: Reign (2006) #1-4 and Spider-Man: Reign 2 (2024) #1-5"
