description: "Revisit the Hulk's incredible early days through the unique Loeb & Sale lens! Before the world knew Bruce Banner was the Hulk. Before Bruce confessed his love to Betty Ross. Before the Hulk was green - there was HULK: GRAY. The explosion of the gamma bomb tore Banner's life apart, unleashing the strongest creature on Earth: the Incredible Hulk! But no matter how powerful he became, his heart still could be shattered by Betty Ross - the daughter of his greatest enemy, General &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross. The Eisner Award-winning team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale offers their ever-insightful look into the foundation of Marvel Comics' most popular heroes, unraveling the Hulk's origin - and uncovering a secret that will change the way we look at Bruce Banner forever! Collecting HULK: GRAY #1-6."
