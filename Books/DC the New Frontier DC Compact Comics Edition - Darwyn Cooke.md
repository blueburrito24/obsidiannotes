description: "&quot;Welcome to the DC Universe in 1950s America--a land of promise and paranoia, of glittering cities and segregated slums, of dizzying scientific progress and simmering Cold War conflict. A land without the Justice League: Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Or so it seems. The masked mystery men who fought for freedom in the Second World War have been outlawed. The soldiers and spies who conducted top-secret missions into the unknown now work in the shadows. And those icons who do still fight on--Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman--operate under hidden agendas and dueling ideologies. Yet this America needs its heroes more than ever. With darkness gathering on the horizon once more, only a bold new generation of adventurers--young, daring, and dedicated to the better angels of our nature--is equal to the challenge of the new frontier&quot;--"
