description: "Powerhouse creative team Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo (Batman: The Court of Owls, Dark Nights: Metal) conclude a decade-long partnership with the Caped Crusader in Batman: Last Knight on Earth. Twenty years in the future, Bruce Wayne wakes up in Arkham Asylum. Young. Sane. And...he's never been Batman. To piece together the mystery of his past, the Dark Knight embarks on a sprawling quest through this unknown world, meeting futuristic versions of former friends and enemies, including a grisly traveling companion--the Joker's head. Somehow still alive, Joker's decapitated head becomes Batman's ghoulish guide through the landscape of the devastated DC Universe. But to unravel the cause of this terrible future, he'll need to track down the unspeakable force that destroyed the world he once knew. This could be the last Batman story ever told... Collects Batman: Last Knight on Earth #1-3"
