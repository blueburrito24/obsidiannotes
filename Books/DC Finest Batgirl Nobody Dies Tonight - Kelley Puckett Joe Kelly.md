description: "Cassandra Cain, the fan-favorite Batgirl introduced at the turn of the millennium, shines in this collection of her early 2000s adventures and team-ups! DC Finest presents comprehensive collections of the most in-demand and celebrated periods in DC Comics history, spanning genres, characters, and eras! DC Finest: Batgirl: Nobody Dies Tonight collects key early appearances of Cassandra Cain, the fan-favorite Batgirl who first appeared in 1999! The daughter of assassins, Cassandra Cain used her unique skills and martial arts prowess to become a hero--and a vastly different Batgirl than fans had seen before. In these tales, from comics talents including writer Kelley Puckett and artist Damion Scott, Cass faces Lady Shiva in a battle to the death, steps up her training with Batman, and teams with fellow teen heroes Superboy and Supergirl! This volume collects stories from Batgirl #7-27, Superboy #85, and Supergirl #63."
