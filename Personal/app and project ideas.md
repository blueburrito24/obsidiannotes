Wishlist app:
be able to add products, including names (string) prices (int) and IDs (int)
add up prices to a total cost
add user-inputted products to a list
print list with individual and total prices
create csv file including all this info so the list can be called when running the program again (can continuously build on wishlist)
Make using python with tkinter for gui

program that determines whether user input is odd or even in java, https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp

### snake
logic: arrows to move object around axis. 
"apple" at random (like actual rng) coords, when object goes near apple the object grows in length 
(object would be a string and string length would affect the visual snake). 
if snake touches axis borders (program would define a visual grid, since the visual is all string/letters it would be e.g., 5x5 of periods with the snake being a squiggly line) the snake string gets spread to the other side (maybe the axis position is reversed?) 
Need to look into "Switch" java technique for this text-based version.

Make a version with sprites for Venom as the snake, Spider-Man as the apple and the background being a huge web.

Mini-RPG game:
1-room rpg, possibly made in javascript
Involves NPC dialogue-interaction, movement, maybe slapping NPCs??
add audios like NPC interaction beeps, background-ambience
Title-screen and exit-door to end the game
Could be Spider-Verse centric -> All NPCs are variants and the room is designed around the HQ from atsv.
Maybe add skin-selector at the end, choose from variety of Spider-variants.

Personal website:
Includes same info as my CV, links to my github and shows off my artworks + thumbnails/storyboards relevant to UI/UX design (How elements of the website design contribute to accessibility etc).
Doesn't need to be super formal, can have fun UI design and random trinkets around like icons and ALSOOO include content in small windows on-screen that can be resized and moved around.
Black forest background with red sparkles and red logos. Webs around the top and bottom borders and the sparkles fall from the webs.
As the user scrolls, a spider crawls down a single webline that falls from the header webs.
