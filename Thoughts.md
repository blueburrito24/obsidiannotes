I wonder if action figures is just going to be unproductive. Like I already struggle with learning and being practical with my learning but I also keep funnelling all my "productive" efforts and energy towards my hobbies. With action figures it reaches the point of money.

I think I should look at all the figures in my wishlist when possible and just think, what do I really want out of these? Like having a collection is one thing but I don't want to have a wall of 300 figures standing there. There needs to be an end goal, not just endless consuming. I have an image of my wishlist but its a bit outdated, so I could use that for visual help. Definitely do it this weekend. 

I need to remember that as much as it sucks to be a retard and not understand this content, it's better that I'm a retard and trying to understand this content than a retard who doesn't try.

I really like drawing but whenever I draw I feel like a degenerate fag. :'<

I don't get it, why do my parents always make such a big deal when I don't want to eat?! :( I literally hold a straight face and just say as monotonously as I can, "I just don't want to eat it" and they get so mad. I just don't want to eat, why is that so bad?? They act so offended for what. I literally just don't want to eat and that's it. I feel like I'm never gonna be thin with stuff like this >:( I always have to eat some random garbage and if I say I can't because of my calories it's rude. I'm sorry YOU'RE always telling me to lose some weight. As much as I think buff guys are hot, I just want to be thin. :(((

I think my only lifelong aspiration ever has been that I want to die. I've never had any pertinent goals in life and I don't really value myself, the one constant is that I've always wanted to die. Sometimes it's by my own hand, sometimes I wish I'd just get struck by lightning, I just hate it here!! :(
Oh also that I want to be thin. I don't envy anyone in particular but it must be sooo nice being thin. No tucking my shirt when I relax in a nice chair, no checking the bus camera to see if I look good. I just want to be thin sooo bad. I think if I walk everyday I can lose weight and importantly lose fat too. 

I don't get why I can't bear being close with people. Being talkative and open with friends is one thing but I don't want to be close to anyone. I want to be alone often. There's no way I get married. :`((((

I still can't believe I jerked off to my OC. I designed him to just be fun to draw- I like big muscles and long hair, but I drew him attractive! I can't dismiss the thought of it. :°< I hope I can keep this feeling down when I draw, I don't want to stop drawing my OCs but I also don't want to become infatuated with them to the point it affects me.
