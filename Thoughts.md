I wonder if action figures is just going to be unproductive. Like I already struggle with learning and being practical with my learning but I also keep funnelling all my "productive" efforts and energy towards my hobbies. With action figures it reaches the point of money.

I think I should look at all the figures in my wishlist when possible and just think, what do I really want out of these? Like having a collection is one thing but I don't want to have a wall of 300 figures standing there. There needs to be an end goal, not just endless consuming. I have an image of my wishlist but its a bit outdated, so I could use that for visual help. Definitely do it this weekend. 

I need to remember that as much as it sucks to be a retard and not understand this content, it's better that I'm a retard and trying to understand this content than a retard who doesn't try.

I really like drawing but whenever I draw I feel like a degenerate fag. :'<

I don't get it, why do my parents always make such a big deal when I don't want to eat?! :( I literally hold a straight face and just say as monotonously as I can, "I just don't want to eat it" and they get so mad. I just don't want to eat, why is that so bad?? They act so offended for what. I literally just don't want to eat and that's it. I feel like I'm never gonna be thin with stuff like this >:( I always have to eat some random garbage and if I say I can't because of my calories it's rude. I'm sorry YOU'RE always telling me to lose some weight. As much as I think buff guys are hot, I just want to be thin. :(((

I think my only lifelong aspiration ever has been that I want to die. I've never had any pertinent goals in life and I don't really value myself, the one constant is that I've always wanted to die. Sometimes it's by my own hand, sometimes I wish I'd just get struck by lightning, I just hate it here!! :(
Oh also that I want to be thin. I don't envy anyone in particular but it must be sooo nice being thin. No tucking my shirt when I relax in a nice chair, no checking the bus camera to see if I look good. I just want to be thin sooo bad. I think if I walk everyday I can lose weight and importantly lose fat too. 

I don't get why I can't bear being close with people. Being talkative and open with friends is one thing but I don't want to be close to anyone. I want to be alone often. There's no way I get married. :`((((

I still can't believe I jerked off to my OC. I designed him to just be fun to draw- I like big muscles and long hair, but I drew him attractive! I can't dismiss the thought of it. :°< I hope I can keep this feeling down when I draw, I don't want to stop drawing my OCs but I also don't want to become infatuated with them to the point it affects me.

Big video ideas.
1. Long-form figure videos would involve [pngtuber graphics](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP6biVvErFQ/?igsh=dTQzeXFzNmg0ZG5k) with hands-on footage
2. short-form figure videos could be edits like [this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSiDItmke7N/?igsh=MWQ3NzloOTZ1bTB4eQ==) with a constant fast clock tick instead of music, jet set, undertale, gta sfx (like the wasted DING with a red flash), sonic cd sfx OR
3. quick posing videos where it's a caption at the start then short cuts of me holding a pose or b-roll of said poses

Could use clipchamp, obs, ditherboy, etc for all sorts of stuff here.
Could have radio-themed edits like [this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSoQi5TjV7u/?igsh=dndocmM5MTRleHc=). Also I want to do stop-motion clips for these edits.

)
Gotta figure out how to do these in clipchamp
Could do the clock tick sfx with a watermark of a clock ticking, it ticks really fast then ticks backwards and slows down to the tick of the edit with a Minecraft eating sfx when it finishes setting the tick speed (because burrito).

I think I need to use capcut. Like a pro apk or something, so I can do those special edit effects like the flickers and stuff. Will be nice.
Also need to find a stop motion app for making the clips for said edits.

It seems like I'll have to download capcut 1.5.0 to use features like the glitch effect.

Should reference the scene of Musaka explaining the Zone in Episode 19 of Cinderella Gray for an edit.

[This](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSv-5ePE1S3/?igsh=bDFyMDd2OTcyOGtl) would be a good reference for a fight scene edit like Goku vs Frieza or something.
Could use [[Jhené Aiko - 2 seconds (Audio).mp3]] in an edit like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSXGvPDEzQr/?hl=en)
Could do an edit with [[STAND PROUD.mp3]]
also!! [[you get me.mp3]] like [this edit](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSpj579jrW8/).
[[CSM Teenager edit.mp3]] is beaaaautiful. Would be good for a sorrowful edit.

I think it'd be cool if I did edits using audio of Meisho Doto and TM Opera O interacting, especially for edits of Goku and Vegeta.

I should animate Goku and Gohan doing [this dance](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDIMhDj2Il/) with [[feeling.mp3]].
