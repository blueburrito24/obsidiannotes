Read and make notes on Story by Robert McKee to improve my writing skill

make a video discussing oda death theory as i commented about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piratefolk/comments/1qvty1c/comment/o4cy5rk/?) with all evidences shown like my nami artstyle analysis, panel comparisons, managing stakes, writing, racism and general insensitivity, etc
Also go in depth with examples of these things like comparing yamato's writing quality to kiku, comparing luffy post and pre ts
Also delve into Oda's misogynistic writing as Mysto outlined [here](https://discord.com/channels/1436916647809253429/1436916648434077769/1470244270698139678)
Defend toei with how the anime is bad because of Oda

make an OC inspired by ulti from one piece

attempt this style of drawings
![[Pasted image 20260205221324.png | 200]]

draw Blue adjusting her texts to wrap around the crack in Yellow's phone screen and him blushing

design a few background characters/template designs for SGW; Deep Sea Kingdom, the Planet, Veral Vine Kingdom, Baron Round Island, etc

i should try shading my drawings the same way i shade sprites, this image below feels like a comparable result

after making my new ocs, make sprites of each of my ocs in hftf style
draw all my ocs hanging out and eating fruit in a hut (there should be a stylish wall clock) 
look for references in "Other Documents".
I'd like to make Shimejis of all my OCs with the proportions of the chibi Chobits characters

Need to watch those NBA videos/channels that Sean (US) sent me.

i want to try and do a paint-like piece on regular ms paint like [this](https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/905575437599652671/).

set up adguard home and bedroom security camera (maybe more after)
also set up vpn that connects to adguard home

read up on [[Crafting Interpreters (Robert Nystrom) (Z-Library).pdf]] and https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html to make an interpreter and compiler.

Look for EPS Placement stuff on blackboard and make a CV including my website iad and other work from first year + work from this year like tp so i can start applying for internships.
