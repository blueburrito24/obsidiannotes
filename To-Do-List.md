I wanna draw expressions more like fma edward and adam warren's artstyle

give bellabella a necklace and glasses that hang around her neck
the mouth thing should be a clothing piece like a jacket, unique to her specific seabed culture (jacket branded with "major oceanic division")
also she really likes sweets like mints and mentos
redraw nico robin asking to join luffy but it's blue asking to be Yellows partner

after making my new ocs, make sprites of each of my ocs in hftf style
draw all my ocs hanging out and eating fruit in a hut (there should be a stylish wall clock)
short comic: blue looks to yellow and asks "what do you think of the sun?" "i think the moon is prettier" they're looking at their burning hut
