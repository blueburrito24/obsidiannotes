description: "Graphic novels to read anywhere: DC Compact Comics collect DC's bestselling, most iconic stories in a new size! Experience Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's incredible Batman epic in a brand-new format for the first time! Christmas. St. Patrick's Day. Easter. As the calendar's days stack up, so do the bodies littered in the streets of Gotham City. A murderer is loose, killing only on holidays. The only man that can stop this fiend? The Dark Knight. In a mystery taking place during Batman's early days of crime-fighting, Batman: The Long Halloween is one of the greatest Dark Knight stories ever told. Working with District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant James Gordon, Batman races against the calendar as he tries to discover who Holiday is before he claims his next victim each month. A mystery that has the reader continually guessing the identity of the killer, this story also ties into the events that transform Harvey Dent into Batman's deadly enemy, Two-Face. The magnificent creative team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale reach their apex in Batman: The Long Halloween."
