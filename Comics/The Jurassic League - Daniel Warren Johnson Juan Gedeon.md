description: "Bear witness to a brand-new—yet older than time—adventure and experience the Justice League as you have never seen them before, as dinosaurs operating as The Jurassic League! You know the story: an infant escapes a far-off planet before it explodes and is deposited on Earth to be raised by human parents. A goddess from a lost city defends truth. A Tyrannosaurus rex dons the visage of a bat to strike fear into evildoers’ hearts. This heroic trinity, alongside a league of other super-powered dinosaurs, join forces to save a prehistoric Earth from the sinister machinations of Darkseid. Wait…what? Okay, maybe you don’t know the story. So join us and bear witness to a brand-new—yet older than time—adventure and experience the Justice League as you have never seen them before!"
