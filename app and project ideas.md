Always try to break down ideas into small, researchable steps.

I need to do simple starter stuff! Look into using pygame to make basic graphical games in Python.
Also Habib linked me a github repo of starter projects.
https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners

could tap into Blender to make models of my characters or just

model in general. Useful and shows a more practical example of creative work.

Look into learning C to get an understanding of programming concepts + use Mugen as a medium for learning and developing C skills. I can use my previous project ideas as practice alongside my older idea for a platformer/beat-em-up.

also the robot boxer game!!!!

input reader:
when the user presses a key, the program outputs what key they're pressing. coded in C.
I would like to then make a version that has icons and can be present on top of your windows on desktop.

"bluekasten.me" (17.27usd per year) means blue box me
a website where i can share posts with both text and images that get archived onto the website on a public board ala late 90s/early 00s blog sites.
would be cool to add visual flair to the site once the basic site is done.
my posts should follow markdown formatting.
use Python and the Manim library for page transitions etc
figma for designing pages
use Laravel for like hosting stuff or whateverrr lol i want to tho

Would be cool if I could replace the viewer's cursor with a little cartoon glove. Would include it as a download in my links.
Little Blue that runs back and forth across the screen when you move your mouse around, if she moves a lot she looks tired.
Little Yellow in the corner who chills but every five minutes he tells you something about the website.
Little Blue and Yellow should be my own 3d models, rendered with three.js as seen [here](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_skinning_additive_blending) and [here](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_multiple). (could be fighterz lobby styled or uma chibi, Kirby 64 inspired too)
Also would be cool if my download links section was a wheel that'd be scrolled through (with the focused piece being magnified) to download stuff. like the moon motif on blue's necklace.
One of the pages should just be a straight up Tetris clone
A lot of the cool arbitrary features could use three.js!

edit the sprites for Yoshin's Broly Z2i to look more like Z2

If I ever want to develop Apple iOS apps, or just want something new after java, look into Swift.

sketchpad:
desktop program that lets you jot down ideas temporarily! they can only be deleted if you close the program.
Would use SVG format files. C ?
would like to add drawing functionality, and make a version with saving.
[this](https://konvajs.org/docs/sandbox/Free_Drawing.html) could be useful for the drawing functionality.

2d and 3d games made in lua with love2d and love3d respectively.
platformers, sandbox, fighting game, etc
could also use c and sdl2.
shovel knight clone.
sonic 1 clone.
dan the man clone.

program that determines whether user input is odd or even in java, https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp

snake desktop app

snake
logic: arrows to move object around axis. 
"apple" at random (like actual rng) coords, when object goes near apple the object grows in length 
(object would be a string and string length would affect the visual snake). 
if snake touches axis borders (program would define a visual grid, since the visual is all string/letters it would be e.g., 5x5 of periods with the snake being a squiggly line) the snake string gets spread to the other side (maybe the axis position is reversed?) 
Need to look into "Switch" java technique for this text-based version.

Sonic clone: "Blue's World"
-2d action platformer featuring Blue! Focuses on Sonic-inspired stages designed around speed and satisfying platforming, featuring a cosy hub world
*"Action is heavy! As you blur through each stage, you'll find strong foes!*
*You can do a combo of A and B attacks on them WHILE running through the stage, dragging them along for the ride, or stand your ground for 1-on-1 combat!"*
-Takes inspiration from Dan the Man and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
*"If you stand your ground, stand proud! You can do a wider range of combos, including air launchers and air combos!"*
*"The only score you need to worry about, is how many evils you face and how many leaps you take!"*
-A velocity-based score system alongside a combo-based score system work in tandem to provide the so-called "World Score".
