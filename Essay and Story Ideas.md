"HAND SIGN"
alien planet terrorised by its apex predators, two people hiding from the predators send off their child who crash lands years later on earth and the alien + our human mc expose the exploitation and trafficking of aliens into the state (non-descript geographical location that they live in that looks suburban)
the apex predators are four-armed people and the aliens are just generic green aliens, there was also mutated predator hybrids called chimera I drew up for the trafficking/exploitation facility and one of the main characters would be one of the mutated hybrids
apex predator aliens called antax in my story differ as such; males  faces their skin never lasts so they've evolved in a way that structure is prioritised but visuals (aka good looking skin and skin being intact around key areas like the mouth and hands) are lost. they are also bald
females have fair skin and hair as they don't fight often but are still fairly robust physically
and the "human" world features animal-like characters as like an artstyle thing, the mc was a bunny girl and one of the later main characters was a former scientist in those facilities who raised the mc hybrid as her daughter (and the scientist is a blue bird lady)
also there was a raccoon girl in the facility and there are robots
