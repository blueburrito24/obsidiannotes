10PM.

I've read my timetables wrong. I've not studied enough. The exam is tomorrow morning, so I need ample rest to perform adequately during it,
I leave my phone to my side, playing "Healing Pod" audio, and I lay flat with my arms across my chest, my eyes shut and my pillows fluffed.
My mind is racing back and forth, I thought I had time to get some more work done but as usual I misread the most important details of the exam.

11PM.

I'm awake. I've been rustling around in my bed and my head is ringing. Maybe I can ask my friend for help, but first I widen my eyes to see if I can adjust myself better to fall asleep better. Two large ears hide the light of the doorway.

I'm awake. There's a sharp knock at my chest, and a snap at the sides,
The silhouette widens.
I'm awake. But I'm not here. The yellow rabbit is going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Sharp ringing again and again.
Why am I awake? There's nothing left of me. Ringing and ringing, my tendons and fibres have been thrown the side and the yellow rabbit is fixated on my ribcage.
Going back and forth and back and forth and.

11PM.

I'm awake. I've been rustling around in my bed and my head is ringing. Maybe I can ask my friend for help. I don't get to widen my eyes.
Sharp knocking at the back of my neck, and a snap at the sides.

11PM.

I'm awake. I've been rustling around in my bed and my head is ringing. Maybe I can ask my friend for help. I widen my eyes and I reach for my phone.
"\*\*\*\*\* I need you :( I can't fall asleep and" and I realise it doesn't matter.
If I'm really awake, he might not respond. If I'm really not awake, he could respond but, it wouldn't change anything.
I leave my phone and think. It doesn't matter, but whether I'm awake or not I have to go through the day.
I get up, I eat and I go to school. I couldn't say if I studied or not.

9:30AM.

I'm awake. I'm at school. Someone asks me how I'm doing. I don't really know them, so it doesn't matter what I say regardless if I'm awake or if I'm not.
So I tell him the truth.

"I don't know if I'm awake.
Every moment is severable.
I could do this exam. I could go about my week. I could get married in a decade's time. But the yellow rabbit accompanies me."

11PM.

I'm awake. I couldn't tell you what just transpired. I widen my eyes, get my phone and check the time. It's late.
I don't know if I'm really awake. I don't fear the yellow rabbit, but I recognise what he stands for. I am always accompanied by a trail. There is a trail of ringing and knocking at my back. Knock. Knock. Knock.

I'm awake.
