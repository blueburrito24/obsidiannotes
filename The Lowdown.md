# obsidian-notes
These are the markdown files for my personal Obsidian note-taking.
Remember that you always commit THEN push, in the commands for uploading the notes to Github.

Also note that you need to re-gen your access token every 30 days (Started 14th October 2025, every month it will be the 14th more or less.)
