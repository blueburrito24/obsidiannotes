- Magneto has arms and hands perfect for Batman. So I will ==saw off X-Cutioner's forearms (at the highest strap) and saw off Magneto's forearms to stick them on with M2 screws for swivel.== I will also do the same for the legs, ==sawing off the X-Cutioner's calves at the highest strap and screwing them onto Magneto's legs for swivel and added musculature and detail.== Also note that I need to ==remove the kneepads on the X-Cutioner calves== and smooth that area after removing it.
- I'm going to use the ball-joint set to ==add a ball-joint waist to the Magneto body.== Following DangITProductions' Wolverine mod video, I'll install carve out the waist-piece and round out the rim of the abdomen piece, then install the connector piece into the abdomen piece and install the joint into the hip-piece using a paperclip.
- I need to ==get rid of the lettering on X-Cutioner's belt== and then the big one - ==shave off the details of his head and sculpt on ears and a "nose". (Reference the last image above.)==
- I also need to ==add toe-articulation (following the tutorial) and cover up the metal rod with putty to maintain the sculpt.==
- Make sure that you ==sand from harsher to softer grits of sandpaper when sanding out the details on the head and smoothing the sculpted ears onto his head.==
- I need to also recreate the neck structure on the X-Cutioner body onto the Magneto body. I can use the same method as I do for adding a ball-joint waist, ==installing a joint connector in the head/neck piece and install a joint via paperclip in the torso (after dremeling it a bit to mimic the torso structure of the X-Cutioner body).==
- After all this, I can ==dye the figure with Rit Synthetic Dye,== at that point I can ==paint the majority of the body grey with the yellow utility belt and black gauntlets and boots plus his white eyes.==
- I can follow the Spider-logo tutorial to make the Bat logo painting easier also.
- At this point the sculpt and painting is done on all fronts, I can now ==use my Loctite super glue to adhere the cape to the ridge of the neck cavity for a clean transition. Make sure to check how the cape fits around the neck before gluing!!==
- Also I want to ==install some magnets into the feet.==
