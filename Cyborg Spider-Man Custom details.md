- I will recast the V64 McFarlane headsculpt and sculpt the base of the bandana and the goggle-strap on the left lense.
- I've chosen to buy a cheap KO of Ryu Hayabusa, so I can just repaint the scarf piece as white and then blackwash it and use it as the bandana piece.
- The bandana needs to be sculpted, alongside the goggle over the lense. I will sculpt the goggle and strap that goes around the whole head, then sculpt the bandana over it.
- Then I will paint the head (mixing my reds to match the body) and painting the goggle silver, mixing my black and red to paint the strap brown. I will then paint the bandana white and blackwash it.
- The inside of the goggle should be painted with a mix of red and metallic silver.
- I will install a hole for a peg to connect the bandana piece at the right side of the headsculpt. 
- I also need to paint yellow and blackwash the utility belt.
- Then I need to sculpt wraps around the right leg using putty and blackwash after drying.
- The logo needs to be painted fully black, so it looks more classic like Alex Ross, instead of having the white glow it has.
- I also want to add the stitches, so I will draw lines onto the body using my micron pens then sculpt little putty pellets and stick them across the lines, then painting them with metallic silver to stand out. The pellets should cover most of the lines.
- After all the main details above, I want to form some plates out of putty and paint them metallic silver, then stick them onto the cyborg arm's shoulder like how the actual design looks.
