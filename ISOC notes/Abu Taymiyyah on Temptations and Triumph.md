*Wisdom from Surah Yusuf*
I want you to read your translated Qur'an and read this verse. Sit and make time, and study it.

Surah Yusuf is a very important surah for us university students. Our society is very normalised with degeneracy and sexualisation, and this Surah is a great aid in this situation.

### Ibn 'Ata' said "No one listens to Surah Yusuf while in sadness except that he finds comfort through it." 

It's important that we engage with the Qur'an regularly, we can find solace and solution in it. Make time. Everyone benefits from it.

# Timeline of Surah Yusuf:
- Dream of Destiny
  Yusuf AS dreams of the sun, moon and eleven stars bowing to him - this is a sign of his future honour. He goes to his father, Ya'qub AS for an interpretation of the dream, whom he trusted more than his brothers. Ya'qub AS created a comfortable and trusting environment for his son, which is why he felt this way.
- Jealousy and Betrayal
  Out of envy, his brothers plot against him and throw him in a well.
- Sold into slavery
  He is found by travellers, taken from his home of Palestine to Egypt and sold in the slave market. In such an age of technology, this could've been a trip of 24 hours.
- Life in the Palace
  Yusuf AS is bought by a nobleman (the king's minister) and raised in his household. He lives in this palace for a long time and grows mature.
- Temptation and False Accusation
  The minister's wife attempts to seduce him; when he refuses, she accuses him falsely.
- Imprisonment
  Yusuf AS is unjustly imprisoned, where he continues to show patience and interprets the dreams of two inmates.
- The King's Dream
  The king sees a vision of seven fat cows and seven lean ones, and seven green stalks of grain and seven dry ones.
- Interpretation and Vindication
  Yusuf AS interprets the dream as seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine, and his innocence is later proven.
- Rise to Power
  Recognizing his wisdom, the king appoints Yusuf AS as the chancellor in charge of the nation's stores.
- The Years of Famine
  The famine strikes, and people from neighbouring lands come to Egypt for food.
- Reunion with His Brothers
  Yusuf's brothers arrive seeking provisions, unaware that the chancellor is their brother.
- Benjamin is taken as captive
  Benjamin is taken and Ya'qub AS has to deal with another heartbreak.
- The Family Reunited
  Yusuf AS's brothers do not recognise him, so he tests their sincerity and remorse before revealing himself. He forgives them, and brings his family to Egypt. His brothers bow to him in awe and respect, fulfilling his dream from prior years.
## 1. He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
Allah taught Yusuf AS to interpret dreams, knowledge that later saved nations.
What we can learn from here, is that not everything we lose is necessarily a loss; perhaps it is replaced with something better by Allah.
These two names of Allah are crucial to our survival. Whether we can make sense of a scenario or not, we can trust in these names that there is good.

Many people look at Gaza currently, of course we see demise and destruction. Many ask why it is still going. But there is good in it also, many have witnessed this destruction and found Islam in it. People are identifying with Gaza and it is shocking the politics of America. Across Europe, since the 7th Oct, conversions to Islam have increased by 400% (according to Global Eye News).
It's important to remember that even if we don't have answers to everything doesn't mean there is no answer or solution.
## 2. Protection from Temptation
1. Immediate refuge in Allah - 'Qala Ma'adh Allah'
2. Recognizing sin's injustice
3. Sincerity purifies the heart
4. Flee from temptation - 'Wastabaqa al-bab'
5. Cling firmly to Allah
6. Persist in du'a with ilhah (desperation)
Yusuf AS was met with the minister's wife in isolation, in which temptation was high, and he resisted it. There is no friendship between the opposite genders.
