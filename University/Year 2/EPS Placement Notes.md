Volunteering is also possible during placement.
"Enterprise Placement" - refers to student-owned/run businesses started for the placement year. You need support from the "Enterprise Placement" programme, which you can apply for up to 25th May 2026.
Cybersecurity Students, and majority other degrees, have compulsory placements which means more encouraged placement application processes.
It's important regardless to be flexible and proactive during placement.
Placement doesn't necessarily have to be relevant to your degree, but would definitely be beneficial.
I think for me personally, placement will help me figure out what I want to do beyond university AKA my career.
Benefits of Placement:
-Build practical/technical work skills.
-Build a professional network.
-Get some bands
