## Lecture Map
- **Lecture 1**
		Information Security is an elemenput of Computer Science in which we tackle the protection of software, hardware and data, the protection of which relies on the [[CIA Triad]]. 
		This "triad" is, namely so, consummated of three concepts - [[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]] and [[Availability]]. 
		These are the three key goals of information security. 
		Tied to these three goals, we have to consider a system's [[Vulnerabilities]], [[Threats]] and [[Controls]].
		There are explicit different [[Classes of Vulnerabilities]] and [[Classes of Controls]].
		We also have to consider [[Control Effectiveness]] and the [[Common Characteristics of Information Security]].
