### LECTURE 1
Software Engineering refers to the methods for analysing, designing, implementing, testing and maintaining software.
The term was coined by Margaret Hamilton under NASA in the 60s, as a title for NATO's conference to discuss software issues, guidelines, practices etc. SE aims to solve failures due to increasing demands and low expectations for software.
SE sets a standard for the programs we produce.

Systems thinking is a holistic (or interconnected) approach to solving problems related to a system's interconnected components change over time, with the goal of the system in mind.

A bicycle is an example of a system because all the parts work together for the goal of movement. The gears, wheels, etc all work together to keep the bicycle driver in motion.
A pile of paper, although a collection of items, is not a system as these items do not work together for any sort of goal.
A tree is a collection of interconnected items, the branches, leaves, roots, they all work together for survival but this might not fit into the definition of a system.

Systems are defined by the following:
- Central Objective
- Integration
- Interaction
- Interdependence
- Organisation/Hierarchy

There are also components we should expect in a system:
- Input, processes, output
- Internal and external environment
- Boundaries of the system
- Interface of the system
- Feedback and control

Control manages the behaviour of the system to achieve its goal.

Complex systems are comprised of various sub-systems. These sub-systems are arranged in hierarchies and integrated (work together) to achieve the goal of the overall system.
When integrated, a system will develop new properties which we can call "emergent properties". These properties can either be functional (emerging the entire system is working to achieve a goal) or non-functional (how the entire system behaves while its operational).

A motorbike weighing 180kg is not an emergent property, the weight of all these parts isn't a new property caused by the system's operation.
A motorbike can be ridden due to its system's operation, so that is an emergent property.
A motorbike's lights can turn on, this is a functional emergent property as the system can do this to make movement easier.
ATMs provide a secure service, this is a non-functional emergent property as the ATM's system goal is just to carry out transactions.

In order to understand and criticise a system, we have to model it AKA create a vision of it.
We have to define the most crucial features of the system; its components, how the components relate to one another, how they interrelate as a system to perform a function, how the system interacts with its environment.

Models allow us to focus on the most important features of a system (abstraction), present our ideas on the system concretely (representation), share our ideas easily (communicate) and check if we meet the requirements for the system (early evaluation).

Models are always abstract - they focus on specific details of a system, software does too. UML is a great way for us to produce models.
