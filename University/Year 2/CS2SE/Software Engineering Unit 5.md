### Lecture 5
"Systems Analysis" is an operation that takes place when we need to define solutions for our requirements. We can't implement anything yet, but are close to doing so. Systems Analysis can overlap with Domain Analysis, seen in [[Software Engineering Unit 2]], but is more technical and a synthesis activity rather than an analysis activity.
