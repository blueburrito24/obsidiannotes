### Lecture 3
Requirements Engineering is how we determine the requirements of a system - what it does, the services it provides and the problems that can be encountered.
"Functional requirements":
- Statements of a system's provided services
- How the system should react to a particular input
- How the system should behave in given situations
- What the system should NOT do in given situations
- Need to be complete and consistent!

"Non-Functional requirements":
- Constraints on services/functions of the system.
- Timing constraints on development due to standards etc.

Non-functional requirements can be more critical than functional requirements. They can be ethical, external, legislative, accounting-related, operational, performance-related, space-related, etc.
The main factor of a non-functional requirement is that it is quantifiable and can be tested.

There are certain metrics for specifying non-functional requirements:
- Speed (response time)
- Size (number of)
- Ease of use (training or help needed)
- Reliability (mean time to failure, unavailability, rate of failure occurence)
- Robustness (time to restart after failure, percentage of events causing failure)
- Portability (percentage of target dependent statements, number of target systems)

There should be an official statement of what software developers need to implement, it covers both user and system requirements alongside functional and non-functional requirements.
