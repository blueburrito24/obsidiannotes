-Sculpt on the details of the Whis Symbol Gi boots and repaint it to match the waist wrap on Tonsen Gogeta.
-Take the skirt piece from Daima Goku and repaint it using Bright Orange to match the gi on KHS Goku, then insert it under the gi/abdomen piece.
-Disassemble KHS Goku's upper body and put the orange sleeves onto the Tonsen Gogeta upper body alongside the actual soft gi piece itself.
-Insert the Tonsen Gogeta torso piece onto the KHS Goku body and remove parts of the abdomen cover if necessary so that it fits with the original gi/abdomen piece (I may want to recast the abdomen piece and paint it with a mix of Elf Skintone and lighter colours I have, so that I can keep the original abdomen piece for later i.e., kitbashes).
-Cut off the orange part of KHS Goku's abdomen cover, cut the waist wrap from Tonsen Gogeta in half and then attach them together (make sure the connector for the waist wrap piece is intact).
-Repaint the wrist wraps from Tonsen Gogeta's torso to match the waist wrap and boots.
-Paint on the Whis training symbol and lines on the gi.
(Note that the shortened waist wrap/abdomen piece will allow for space for the skirt piece while keeping the articulation and visuals intact)
